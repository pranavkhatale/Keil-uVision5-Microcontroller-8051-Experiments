1. Arithematic Operations: Addition, Substraction, Multiplication, Division of two 8 bit numbers
2. Transfer Block of Data
3. Exchange the 10 byte of data between 20H memory location and 30H memory location
4. Logical operations : AND, OR, XOR & NOT of 45H and 67H, store the result from 20H
5. Find the smallest & largest number in a given array starting from 5000H memory location and stored the result in 60H memory location
6. Sort a given array in Ascendng & Descending order
7. Display "INDIA" in ROM space strating at 250H also transfer the bytes into RAM location starting at 40H
8. Generate a square wave of 50% duty cycle on the P1
9. Generate a triangular wave
